# Slicer Setup

All modern mainstream slicers are able to produce high quality prints when properly configured for your printer. The Voron community maintenances a set of slicer profiles that you can use as a known good starting point for further tuning.

Proper understanding of slicer settings will have a tremendous impact on print results. Try to learn more about your favorite slicer and tweak the settings to meet your needs.

While using different slicers for different kinds of prints can be beneficial avoid blindly hopping between slicers and slicer profiles just because someone posted a nice print sliced with a different slicer.

## Slicer Selection

There are two slicers that come with built in profiles for most Voron printers:

* Cura
* Super Slicer

Other slicers that can be configured to support Voron printers but may not have built in support:

* Prusa Slicer
* Simplify3D
* Slic3r

## Slicer Profile Creation

Some pre-built slicer profiles are available.

## Preheat and Start Sequences

For maximum quality and accuracy, preheating the printer is highly recommended.
