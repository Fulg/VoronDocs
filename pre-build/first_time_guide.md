# Welcome

Welcome to the world of Voron printers!

This is a guide to help orient newcomers in selecting and building their first Voron printer.

# Printer Models

There are currently 4 printers in the Voron lineup.  One is not necessarily better than the other, just different.  All printers are capable of being fully enclosed to print ABS but can just as easily print PLA, PETG, or even Nylon.  All printers in the Voron lineup are designed to use a Raspberry Pi on top of a motor controller board to manage all of their functions and interface controls.

## Voron 0

The [Voron 0](http://vorondesign.com/voron0) (or V0) is a super-compact desktop-sized CoreXY printer with a cantilevered bed.  Build volume is 120x120x120.  Typical build cost is around $700.

## Voron 1

The [Voron 1](http://vorondesign.com/voron1.8) (or V1) is a more traditional CoreXY design with a fixed gantry and a moving print bed.  The print bed rides on four rods and is driven by two independent Z motors.  Standard print volumes are 250x250x230 and 300x300x230.  Typical build cost is around $1200.

## Voron 2

The [Voron 2](http://vorondesign.com/voron2.4) (or V2) is a bleeding-edge CoreXY design that uses a fixed build plate and a flying gantry driven by four independent belted Z motors.  Movements in all 3 axis reach maximum speeds.  Standard print volumes are 250x250x230, 300x300x280, and 350x350x330.  Typical build cost is around $1700.

## Switchwire

The [Switchwire](http://vorondesign.com/voron_switchwire) is the reimagining of a typical bedslinger.  Instead of being CoreXY it is CoreXZ with the Voron aesthetic throughout.  It repurposes many of the components from a Prusa Mk3s and results in the identical print volume of 250x210x210.  Typical build cost is around $600, even less if an existing Prusa is repurposed.

# Building the Printer

## Printing Parts

As Voron printers are typically enclosed and are designed to be able to print at higher temperatures the printed parts are strongly recommended to be printed in ABS for temperature resistance.  If the prospective Voron owner is not currently able to print in ABS for some reason, we recommend looking at the Voron [print-it-forward (PIF) program](https://pif.voron.dev), where individuals can submit a request for another Voron owner to print the minimum functional parts for them.

## Ordering Parts

For every printer on the main webpage, There is an option to generate a bill of materials (BOM).  That is the definitive guide for what parts are required for that printer.  The BOM also references the sourcing guide.  The sourcing guide is a list of recommended vendors for the various components that are required to build a printer.  While there may be quantities listed on the sourcing guide, those numbers are not guaranteed to be accurate and we strongly. use people to reference the BOM for specific quantities.

_Note:_ The generated part numbers for Misumi extrusions are the exact part numbers.  Plug them into Misumi's website and they will return exactly what needs to be ordered, down to drilling holes and tapping ends.

There are a growing number of suppliers that are assembling kits to build Voron printers.  Outside of the sourcing guide, Voron does not implicitly endorse any specific vendor of Voron kits.

### Recommendations

* Get on Discord!  There is a very active community on the [Voron Discord Server](https://discord.gg/voron).
* When purchasing small items, buy extras (round up).  Having a few extra screws or connectors around may actually help you later.
* Check the [FAQ](./faq.md)
